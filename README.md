# Delphi-DistanceOnImage
Simple demo showing how to load a JPG in a TImage and resizing
the view so that the entire image fits is TImage.

Show how to compute the distance between two mouse click,
expressed in the coordinate space of the image.

The code is kept as simple as possible. There should be more
tests to prevent bad behavior with invalid parameters.
